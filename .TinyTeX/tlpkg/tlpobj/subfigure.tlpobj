shortdesc Deprecated: Figures divided into subfigures
longdesc Provides support for the manipulation and reference of small or
longdesc 'sub' figures and tables within a single figure or table
longdesc environment. It is convenient to use this package when your
longdesc subfigures are to be separately captioned, referenced, or are
longdesc to be included in the List-of-Figures. A new \subfigure command
longdesc is introduced which can be used inside a figure environment for
longdesc each subfigure. An optional first argument is used as the
longdesc caption for that subfigure. The package is now considered
longdesc obsolete: it was superseded by subfig, but users may find the
longdesc more recent subcaption package more satisfactory.
