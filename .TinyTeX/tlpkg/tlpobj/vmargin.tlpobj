shortdesc Set various page dimensions
longdesc Provides a macro to set various margins as well as dimensions
longdesc for header/footer and page dimensions. Most common paper sizes,
longdesc paper orientation, disabling of headers and footers, and two
longdesc sided printing are supported. The vmargin package does not rely
longdesc on other packages and was designed with speed and size in mind.
longdesc Its user interface might not be very fancy, but it's fast,
longdesc small, and gets the job done. If you are looking for something
longdesc more elaborate try the geometry package.
