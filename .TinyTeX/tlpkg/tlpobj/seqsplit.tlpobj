shortdesc Split long sequences of characters in a neutral way
longdesc When one needs to type long sequences of letters (such as in
longdesc base-sequences in genes) or of numbers (such as calculations of
longdesc transcendental numbers), there's no obvious break points to be
longdesc found. The package provides a command \seqsplit, which makes
longdesc its argument splittable anywhere, and then leaves the TeX
longdesc paragraph-maker to do the splitting. While the package may
longdesc obviously be used to typeset DNA sequences, the user may
longdesc consider the dnaseq as a rather more powerful alternative.
