shortdesc Support for multiple-weight font packages
longdesc Many font families available for use with LaTeX are available
longdesc at multiple weights. Many Type 1-oriented support packages for
longdesc such fonts re-define the standard \mddefault or \bfdefault
longdesc macros. This can create difficulties if the weight desired for
longdesc one font family isn't available for another font family, or if
longdesc it differs from the weight desired for another font family. The
longdesc package provides a solution to these difficulties.
