shortdesc Move floats to the end, leaving markers where they belong
longdesc Place all floats on pages by themselves at the end of the
longdesc document, optionally leaving markers like "[Figure 3 about
longdesc here]" in the text near to where the figure (or table) would
longdesc normally have occurred. Float types figure and table are
longdesc recognised by the package, unmodified. Since several packages
longdesc define other types of float, it is possible to register these
longdesc float types with endfloat.
